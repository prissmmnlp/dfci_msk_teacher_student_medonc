HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Doe is a 58-year-old female with metastatic estrogen receptor (ER) positive, HER2 negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast, initially diagnosed in May 2021.

She was started on gemcitabine and carboplatin in February 2023 with an initial minor response but developed worsening bony pain and general malaise over the past several months. Restaging scans this week showed further increase in the size and number of the liver and bony metastases.

CC: Follow-up for recurrent colorectal cancer

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mr. Doe is a 63-year-old male with a history of colorectal adenocarcinoma, initially diagnosed in April 2020 after presenting with hematochezia and anemia. He underwent a low anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis and loop ileostomy in May 2020. Surgical pathology showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma extending through the muscularis propria into the pericolic adipose tissue (pT3). Fourteen of 22 regional lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma (pN2a). Staging was pT3 pN2a M0, stage IIIC. He received adjuvant FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) chemotherapy from July-December 2020, completing 12 cycles. His ileostomy was reversed in January 2021. Surveillance CEA levels and CT scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis were unremarkable until the most recent scans.

CURRENT SYMPTOMS:
Mr. Doe reports having intermittent left lower quadrant abdominal pain over the past 2 months, describing it as a dull, achy discomfort rating 4/10 in severity. He denies nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, or rectal bleeding. He also notes a 5-pound unintentional weight loss over the past few months despite a good appetite. He has no fevers, chills, or night sweats.

IMAGING:

CT Abdomen/Pelvis with Contrast (Today's Date):

IMPRESSION:

Interval development of multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left perirectal/pelvic sidewall region measuring up to 2.8 cm (previously unremarkable on prior imaging), concerning for lymph node metastases.
No evidence of local recurrence at the prior surgical anastomotic site.
No other evidence of distant metastatic disease.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:

Recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma with locoregional lymph node metastases, based on significantly elevated CEA level and new enlargement of left pelvic lymph nodes on CT imaging compared to prior studies.
I have discussed this with the patient in detail, including the likely need for systemic chemotherapy given the apparent oligometastatic relapse pattern. Although surgical resection may potentially be an option depending on multidisciplinary tumor board review, the location and number of positive nodes may preclude complete cytoreduction.
The patient understands and wishes to proceed with further treatment. We have obtained expedited approval for testing on the prior surgical specimen for RAS/BRAF mutational status to guide systemic therapy choices.
I have obtained informed consent and placed orders today for:
Tumor genomic testing (RAS/BRAF/MSI/MMR) on existing surgical specimen
Repeat CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast in 2 weeks
Anal/pelvic MRI with IV contrast
Tumor board review to discuss optimal treatment approach
We will reconvene after the above testing is complete to discuss therapies in more detail. Likely treatment options will include:
Combination chemotherapy (e.g. FOLFIRI or FOLFOX if RAS/BRAF wildtype)
Possible addition of biologic agent (e.g. cetuximab, panitumumab) if RAS wildtype
Consideration of radiation therapy ± chemosensitization
Possibility of surgical resection if complete cytoreduction feasible per tumor board assessment
The patient agrees to proceed with an aggressive, multidisciplinary approach. We will continue close outpatient follow-up."

patient is a 68-year-old female with metastatic bladder urothelial carcinoma, initially diagnosed in November 2022 after presenting with gross hematuria. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with dose-dense MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin) followed by radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection in February 2023. Pathology showed pT3bN2 high-grade urothelial carcinoma with extravesical extension and 4/22 pelvic lymph nodes positive. She was then started on adjuvant pembrolizumab immunotherapy in April 2023.

In July 2023, restaging CT scan demonstrated new metastatic lesions in the lung, bone (right femur), and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. She was started on combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin along with denosumab for bone metastases. After 4 cycles, a CT scan in October 2023 revealed mixed response with slight progression of the lung lesions.

Her treatment was changed to enfortumab vedotin-ejfv in November 2023. The patient reports currently feeling well overall, with good energy and appetite. She endorses occasional mild nausea but denies vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. She notes some persistent mild right hip pain but no new bone pain. She denies cough, shortness of breath, or weight loss.

Chief Complaint: Follow-up for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma with brain metastases

Oncologic History:
Mr. Doe is a 54-year-old male with a past medical history notable for clear cell renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in 2021 after presenting with hematuria. He underwent a right radical nephrectomy at that time, with pathology revealing a 6.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma, Fuhrman grade 3, with sarcomatoid differentiation and extension into the perinephric fat (pT3a).

He had an initial disease-free interval but developed widespread metastatic disease in 2022 with lesions identified in the lungs, liver, and brain on restaging scans. He received whole brain radiation in July 2022 for numerous brain metastases, as well as initiating systemic therapy with cabozantinib.

His treatment course was complicated by significant adverse effects from the cabozantinib, including fatigue, diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, and uncontrolled hypertension, requiring multiple dose reductions. Therapy was discontinued in November 2022 due to intolerance.

He was then treated with second-line nivolumab starting in December 2022, with an initial mixed response on scans in February 2023 showing slight progression of some lesions and regression of others.

Current Symptoms:
Mr. Doe reports increased headaches, nausea, and intermittent word-finding difficulties over the past 3 weeks. He denies fever, vision changes, or focal weakness/numbness.

Medications:

Nivolumab 480 mg IV q4 weeks
Ondansetron 8 mg daily as needed for nausea
Ibuprofen 600 mg q6h prn for headaches
Allergies: No known drug allergies

Vitals:
Temp 98.2 F, BP 142/88, HR 82, RR 16, SpO2 96% on room air

Physical Exam:
General: Alert and oriented x3. Mild distress secondary to headache.
Head and Neck: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Tenderness to palpation over occipital region.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1/S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes/rhonchi/rales.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly. Well-healed right subcostal incision.
Musculoskeletal: Full strength in all 4 extremities, no focal deficits.

Imaging:
Brain MRI (3/19/2024): Interval progression of multiple enhancing mass lesions throughout the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres compared to prior MRI from 2/15/2023, with several lesions demonstrating increased size, edema, and mass effect. The largest lesion is a 3.8 x 3.2 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass centered within the left parietal lobe with significant surrounding vasogenic edema and subfalcine herniation. There is also a large hemorrhagic left cerebellar mass measuring 2.7 cm and numerous smaller enhancing lesions diffusely involving the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally. Findings are consistent with progressive metastatic disease.

Chest/Abdomen CT (3/12/2024): Stable to slightly increased size of pulmonary metastases bilaterally compared to prior, with the largest lesions in the right upper lobe measuring up to 2.4 cm and a 3.1 cm lesion in the left lower lobe. New hydropic changes within the liver consistent with progressive hepatic metastases, with a dominant lesion in segment 8 measuring 5.2 cm.

Assessment:

Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma with progressive brain metastases
Progressive systemic metastases in lungs and liver
Plan:

Initiate high-dose dexamethasone 16 mg PO/IV daily for cerebral edema
Increase ondansetron to 8 mg TID scheduled for nausea prophylaxis
Obtain neurosurgery and radiation oncology consultations to evaluate for surgical resection and/or stereotactic radiosurgery for large symptomatic brain lesions
If not a candidate for local therapy, consider change in systemic regimen to cabozantinib and nivolumab combination immunotherapy per CBRPM updated guidelines
